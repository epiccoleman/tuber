I made this post a few days ago as just
a simple reminder that getting in shape
isn't complicated because I don't lift
six days a week. My workouts aren't two
hours long and I don't take a bunch of
supplements or follow some extreme diet.
Everything that I do to stay lean and
jacked is simple. And my goal of this
channel is to teach you how to do the
same because my first few years in the
gym were nothing but overwhelmed from
the massive amount of information and
contradictions. And I know you guys can
relate to exactly what I'm describing
because I get comments and messages from
you every single day. So after making
that post, someone replied and asked,
"What is the fitness industry trying to
feed us?" I told them the truth.
Complexity, artificial supplements that
are actually harmful to your health and
bad for you and that you don't need
gimmicks, trends, and the idea that you
have to live in the gym or buy what
they're selling to make progress. You
guys have to understand the fitness
industry literally makes billions every
year. And it keeps growing because
people keep searching for shortcuts. And
the more confused you are, the more you
buy. People want to believe it's
complicated because that makes their
excuses valid. But the reality is it's
simple. It's always been simple. So, the
goal of this video is to show you the
handful of things that actually matter
to getting you jacked. Things that only
take a few hours a week and can put you
in the best shape of your life. We're
going to start with how many times a
week you should be lifting. For 99% of
people, 3 to 4 days is all you need. And
four is probably better in the beginning
since you'll get more practice overall.
But as you advance in your lifting
journey, doing less but with more
intensity is probably the best bet. Most
people don't need more workouts. They
need better workouts, more intense
workouts. When you train 3 or 4 days a
week, you recover enough to actually get
stronger from session to session. And
getting stronger in a moderate rep range
is why you build most muscle. It's not
the pump. It's not some pyramid bicep
workout. It's definitely not a shock the
muscle routine you found on TikTok. And
it's not a 2-hour long arm day. It's
looking at your incline dumbbell press
and seeing that you started with 45 lbs
for seven reps in each hand and now a
year later you're pressing 80s for 10
reps. And I want to repeat this point.
Getting stronger in a moderate rep range
is why you build most muscle. And this
reminds me of when I was in the
beginning stages of lifting. I would do
something called 21s with a training
partner. And we would start with seven
reps of barbell curls and then we would
literally pass it back and forth until
we reached 21 reps and then keep
repeating until we couldn't move our
arms. And you know, now I look back and
kind of just shake my head. Yes, it
built some muscle, like maybe, but
really all it did was give me a pump.
And what I'm trying to get at is you
don't need these fancy tricks or tactics
like 21s that sound cool. We would have
been better off just starting with two
to three sets of six reps for the
barbell curls and then adding a
repetition each week and then eventually
adding weight when we reach the top end
of that rep range. And this is what I
want you guys to understand. If your
lifts aren't going up, your physique
isn't changing. It's that simple. This
is why I push three to four days so
consistently. It allows a normal person
to get stronger week after week. Because
if you think about it, you work a job.
Your sleep is probably okay, but it's
not perfect. You're stressed most days.
You're not hitting your macros or
calories exactly like you should. You're
not drinking enough water. Trying to
train six days a week on top of all that
is just going to burn you out because
the other important things are so out of
alignment. That's why they end up
stalling, they get injured, or they
eventually quit. 3 to 4 days fixes all
of that because you recover, you
progress, you stay consistent, you
actually build strength week after week
and your physique changes because the
training is finally working. And
remember, most of you guys are just
training to look good in normal clothes
or at the beach and be strong and
healthy for life. So, in my opinion, 3
to 4 days a week is the most sustainable
and will still get you 99% of your
gains. Next, we're going to talk about
walking 10k steps a day. And I'm not
going to spend a ton of time on this
one, but walking handles more than
people realize. It keeps you lean. It
helps with digestion. It reduces overall
stress. And it's going to improve your
recovery because it's low effort. It's
low fatigue. And once again, if it's
done consistently, this is going to keep
you lean without having to do complex
cardio. And the next thing is going to
be eating a real food diet. And for you
guys that continue to watch my content,
you're going to know that I talk about 3
to 4 day a week training in a real food
diet. Like I get so repetitive, but
understand if you stick to whole foods,
so meat, eggs, fruit, honey, potatoes,
rice, maybe some vegetables, you
automatically control your calories
without tracking obsessively. Like I'm
seeing all these people using this like
AI app. Like I honestly shouldn't even
shout it out on the channel because it's
so much BS, but they literally email me
every single week trying to get me to
sponsor it. And it's like you don't need
an app when you're eating whole foods.
Like if you're really trying to dial in
and get like super lean or, you know,
you have these like really concrete
goals, you know, yeah, it might be
beneficial to track, but for the most
part, when you control your calories
with whole foods, you just automatically
get lean. And I'm not saying you can't
overeat on whole foods, but most people
will be satiated after three to four
whole food meals. And you avoid the
constant hunger that's going to come
from processed food. And I actually just
made a full day of eating video breaking
down, you know, exactly what a whole
food diet looks like and, you know, what
I consume. So, I'll link that on the
screen somewhere now if you want to see
exactly what I eat in a day. So, so far
we've talked about lifting, walking, and
then eating real whole foods. Next is
going to be getting sunlight. And I
would almost guarantee that 80% of you
right now are like, "What does sunlight
have to do with getting jacked or
getting in shape?" Sunlight is basically
your body's start button. So, if you're
in tune with the research, when you get
morning sunlight in your eyes, it tells
your brain to turn on your energy, your
focus, and basically your muscle
building hormones. It's also going to
set up your sleep clock so you can
actually recover at night because that's
when muscle growth happens. Because most
people stare at a screen, they rush to
work, they sit inside under artificial
lights all day, and they never actually
see the sun. So, their body never gets
the signal to fully wake up, their
energy stays low, their mood stays flat,
and their sleep is going to get worse.
And I can promise you guys, if you are
trying to build muscle, that is going to
kill your progress. And I really
encourage you guys to do more research
on vitamin D, maybe even get your
vitamin D levels checked and just the
importance of getting daily sunlight
because it really does matter for your
mood, for recovery, and then your
testosterone. And how much sunlight
you're going to need daily is obviously
going to vary from person to person. But
this is truly a super simple thing that
could be why your testosterone is low
and you're not making the best gains.
And the next thing we're going to talk
about is sleeping 7 to 9 hours. And this
should be common sense, but common sense
isn't always common practice. Look at it
like this. If your sleep is bad,
everything else suffers. Strength,
testosterone, fat loss, recovery, all of
it. Good sleep is one of the most
powerful performance enhancers you can
give yourself, and it's free. So, what I
do each night is I set my thermostat
down to a cooler temp. Mine is normally
around 66°. Use blackout curtains, and
try to avoid your phone or any blue
light a few hours before bed. I also
take a magnesium glycinate supplement
before bed for deeper sleep, so you can
research that as well as vitamin D. And
next, we're going to talk about
hydration. So being even a little
dehydrated ruins your strength, your
pump, and your energy, and most guys
walk around tired for no reason other
than they barely drink any water. Once
again, common sense isn't common
practice. And an easy way to get a rough
number of how much water you need in a
day is to take your body weight and just
cut it in half. That's going to give you
the correct amount of ounces. Then you
can go to Amazon or wherever and just
buy yourself a dedicated stainless steel
water bottle and just get as big of one
as possible so you have to fill it up
less times and then actually track it
each day. You might actually find this
whole time that you were simply
dehydrated and that's why your workouts
were suffering. So, it wasn't your
program, it wasn't your diet, it wasn't
anything other than you weren't drinking
enough water. That's why I tell you guys
so frequently to track. And I'm going to
be honest, this one is the most boring
and it's the most overused, but it's the
most important. It's be consistent. And
I really, really want you guys to
understand this. You can do all the
things I just laid out, but if you only
last two weeks, nothing's going to
happen. You must be consistent for
months and then even years. So, I want
you to lift, walk each day, eat real
food, get sunlight, sleep, hydrate, and
repeat. It works. It's always worked.
And people only miss it because they're
too busy looking for something more
complicated. And if you guys want a

each and every one of you guys that
comments and tunes into each video. I'll
talk to you guys in the next one. Peace.
